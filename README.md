 Authentication (Signup & Login)
This project supports user authentication using NextAuth.js, with two sign-in methods:

1. üîí Custom Email/Password (Credentials Provider)
‚ûï Signup
Users can register using a form that collects:

Full Name

Email Address

Password

Upon submission, an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to the user's email for verification.

Once the OTP is verified, the user is automatically logged in and provided:

accessToken

refreshToken

user data

The session is managed using NextAuth.js with signIn("credentials").

üîê Login
Users can log in via the email/password form.

On success, the server returns the accessToken and refreshToken, and the user is signed in via signIn("credentials").

2. üü¢ Google OAuth
Users can sign in with their Google account using the "Continue with Google" button.

This method is powered by NextAuth‚Äôs Google provider.

A session is automatically created and persisted.

üì¶ Session Management
The app uses NextAuth.js for consistent session handling across both login methods.

Authenticated API requests use the bearer token (accessToken) to interact with protected endpoints.
